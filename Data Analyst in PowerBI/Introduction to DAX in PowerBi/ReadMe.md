### Introduction to DAX in PowerBi

## Getting Started with DAX
- Created a Calculated Column 'Profit' - Sales - Cost
- Used that attribute to create a clustered column chart to analyze profit each year
- Created a Calculated Measure called - 'SalesCount' to count the distinct order count
- Used hierarchy to expand and drill the sales count and identified the sales order was maximum in May 2020
- Created a measure for TotalProfit by doing the sum of Profit
- Computed ProfitMarginRatio by dividing the total profit by total sales and observed the year 2019 has the highest ProfitMarginRatio
