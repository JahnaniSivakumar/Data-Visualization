## Introduction to PowerBi
Dataset: World Wide Importers (WWI)

### Getting Started with PowerBi

- Analyzing the Quanttites sold across every year
- Total profit earned by WWI
- Exploring how each salesperson in WWI contributed to the quantity of items sold and profit generated
- Comparing the types of quantities sold: Dry products or Chilled products

### Transforming the data

- Transformed the dataset before loading, such as removing the top dummy row, unwanted columns, etc.
- Identified the minimum total (including tax) sales for each buying group 
- Formatted and cleaned the data to get Average Credit limits and Total sales (including tax)
- Visualized the state or province using maps and identified the highest profit-yielding state 
- The buying group acts as a filter to slice the data and KPIs for each customer buying group
- Washington has the highest profit average for the Wingtip toys buying group


### Visualizing Data

- Converted a Doughnut chart to a tree map
- Formatted the title's font style and size
- Changed a card view to a multi-card view by segmenting it with a scenario name 
- Replaced a table with a matrix
- Formatted the row and column headers along with values
- Fixed a theme to the report and edited all the charts to be of same height and width\
